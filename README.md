# Head First Python 2nd Edition

This repository contains the code for Head First Python 2nd Edition, by Paul Barry. It contains all the code files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
The book begins with the Python language fundamentals, working with built-in data structures and functions. It then takes the reader through the building of a webapp, exploring database management, exception handling, and data wrangling. Other Python language aspects that are dealt with include: context managers, decorators, comprehensions, and generators.

The code samples have been tested using Python 3.7

## Installation

The webapp uses flask framework. To install flask on a Unix-like
OS running Python 3 use the following command:

```
sudo -H python3 -m pip install flask
```

In case you are running Python 3 on Windows use:

```
py -3 -m pip install flask
```
